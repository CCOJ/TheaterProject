List of bugs when running the application:

[PRIORITY] - Need an input check for the dates to make sure the endDate comes after a beginning date in the Add A Show function in the Controller.

- If stored data is found, the user has the option to use it. The user may also invoke a command to load data, provided he/she has not yet issued any data-related commands in that session.

- If client is deleted before all shows then those shows are permanently in the Theater ShowList with no way of deleting or retrieving.

- ClientID, cardNumber, expirationDate are allowing null values when adding a new Client.
- When Client ID is left blank when removing removing a client the program crashes
- Name, address, phoneNumber, cardNumber, and card expiration date are allowing null when adding a Customer.




Missing Functionality:
- Adding a show there needs to be a check to make sure that the Client is in the system.
- Adding a show needs to check that it won't overlap with any other shows.
-
