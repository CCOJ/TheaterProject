List of bugs when running the application:

- ClientID, cardNumber, expirationDate are allowing null values when adding a new Client.
- When Client ID is left blank when removing removing a client the program crashes
- Name, address, phoneNumber, cardNumber, and card expiration date are allowing null when adding a Customer.




Missing Functionality:
- Adding a show there needs to be a check to make sure that the Client is in the system.
- Adding a show needs to check that it won't overlap with any other shows.
-
